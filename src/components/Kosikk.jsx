              Dear Vidushi,
I haven't really written a letter since "chutti mangthe hue gauravaneey
adhyapika ko pathr likhiye", so this is going to be my best (or worst)
attempt.
<br />
Just as I sat down to write this, I tried to trace back when we started
roaming together and all the wild and crazy things we did in the past
sem which achanak se mere mind me aagaye (hindi :cool).  There was a
warmth to all of it and it was truly really really wild.
<br />
From the constant dark humor to the bhayanak drink mixture we drank and
that "trek" and all the dance :hidesface which I cant believe I did -
your honor I was peer pressured.  I must say tho, I haven't taken or been
in so many pictures and videos all of 1 to 5 sems combined than in our
last sem itself which is really :coooooolllll and all of it thanks to your
amazing phyootograhyy skyillsss!!.
<br />
Ohhhhhh and all those late night meets are fucking greattt.
:italian hand gesture (idk what they call it, that crisp sign, ok im really
bad at describing things).  All that random stuff that we did, monopoly,
filmsss (remeber Rockstar, legit smh don't know how you didnt like
it :lmao, RK &#60;&#60;&#60; AK :smirk), ganja, deadshot, vere level talks.  OH OH OH,
by the way I remember every word of what you told me about marwadi
weddings - super :littt (GLASS PAGES BOOK) andddddddddd how can I not
remember all the gossip talkssss (vaaw, this repeated letter bug caught
me too huh :lmao).
<br />
I know I don't really open up that much but even when I'm feeling kind
of depression I come to mf meet or meet you guys and everything feels light
again.  I dont know man I get this wholesome feel when we take those
walks through college and believe me I missed these in this past month
since our (ahem my) holidays.  I've missed you and Vikas very much
(Dhanwanth ante emundi le, I keep meeting) so you don't know how much
that lunch we had the other day meant to me.  This is getting kind of sad
:lol.
